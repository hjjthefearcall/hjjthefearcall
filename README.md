Hi hi

Interact n c+h are welcomed unless name statess otherwise. Whisper if you want to interact. Away means I'm away!! Please wait before you interact if you see that

__Currat n his friends dni__. Proshippers dni sorry, I know it has two meanings but both of them makes me feel icky. Other than that basic dni list

I feel uncomfortable sharing my age unless I have to. If it's not important then please don't ask about my age

Copinglink and fictionkin. Brandon and  is me. I like a ton of fandoms, ones that I like the most are Phighting, DOA8BW, Bumi by Tere Liye, sherlock holmes, and args in general, but mostly ones that have religious themes and so many more that I can't fit in here. Even if you don't see your fandom here please do talk to me

I love my platonic husband

May be nervous when talking to new people, or maybe my body hates me and gives me a horrible headache, just continue to talk if I suddenly stay quiet

OK? OK? Goodybye
